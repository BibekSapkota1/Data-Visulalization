# Importing Datasets and library
```{r}
ToothGrowth$dose <- as.factor(ToothGrowth$dose)
library(ggplot2)
```

# Boxplot themes
```{r}
p <- ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x=dose,y=len))+geom_boxplot()
p
```
Interpretation: Creating a simple graph


```{r}
p + theme_gray()
```
Interpretation: theme_gray changes the background colour to gray and gride lines to white

```{r}
p + theme_bw()
```
Interpretation: theme_bw chages the background to white and grid lines to gray.

```{r}
p + theme_linedraw()
```
Interpretation: theme_linedraw creates a black lines around the plot and changes the grid line to black

```{r}
p + theme_light()
```
Interpretation: theme_light creates themes with light gray lines  abd axis

```{r}
p + theme_minimal()
```
Interpretation: theme_minimal creates themes with no background colour

```{r}
p + theme_classic()
```
Interpretation: theme_classic creates themes with axis lines(x-axis & y-axis) with ni grid lines

```{r}
p + theme_void()
```
Interpretation: theme_void creates theme empty, with non-standard coordinates

```{r}
p + theme_dark()
```
Interpretation: theme_dark creates themes with dark background.

```{r}
p + theme_set(theme_gray(base_size=20))
```
Interpretation: theme_set sets the size of all the plot text elements(i.e. base_size=20 sets size to 20)

```{r}
ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x=dose, y=len))+ geom_boxplot()
```

```{r}
ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x=dose, y=len))+geom_boxplot()+
  theme_classic(base_size = 25)
```
Interpretation: theme_classic creates with axis line and no grid line and then base_size changes the text size to 25.

```{r}
p+theme(
  panel.background = element_rect(fill = "lightblue",
         colour = "lightblue",
         size = 0.5, linetype = "solid"),
 panel.grid.major = element_line(size = 0.5, linetype = 'solid',
         colour = "white"), 
 panel.grid.minor = element_line(size = 0.25, linetype = 'solid',
         colour = "white")
)
```
Interpretation: This theme sets a light blue background with white grid lines. The major grid lines are medium thickness, and the minor ones are thinner, both solid white.

```{r}
p + theme(panel.border = element_blank(),
          panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
          panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```
Interpretation: This theme removes the panel border and both major and minor grid lines, creating a minimalist and clean plot appearance.

```{r}
p + theme(panel.border = element_blank(),
          panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
          panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
          axis.line = element_line(size = 0.5, linetype = "solid", colour="black"))
```
Interpretation: This theme removes the panel border and grid lines while adding solid black axis lines with medium thickness. It simplifies the plot while emphasizing the axes.

```{r}
p+theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "darkblue"))
```
Interpretation:This theme add darkblue colour to graph.

# Use a custome theme
```{r}
#install.packages("ggthemes")
library(ggthemes)
```


```{r}
ggplot(diamonds,aes(carat,price))+
  geom_point()+theme_tufte()
```


```{r}
p <- ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, colour = Species))+
 geom_point()
# Use economist color scales
p + theme_economist() +
 ggtitle("Iris data sets")
```
Interpretation: This plot uses the theme_economist(inspired by The Economist magazine.) with a light blue background and white grid lines. Points are colored by species, and the title is at the top. 

```{r}
p + theme_stata()+
  ggtitle("Iris data")
```
Interpretation: This plot uses the theme_stata() for a clean, data-focused appearance inspired by Stata software. 

```{r}
p + theme_wsj()+
  ggtitle("Iris data")
```
Interpretation: This plot uses the theme_wsj() for a clean, data-focused appearance inspired by various publications and styles.

```{r}
p + theme_calc()+
  ggtitle("Iris data")
```
Interpretation:  This theme_calc() theme offers a clean and simple design, inspired by Calc, with a focus on readability and minimal visual clutter,

```{r}
p+ theme_hc()+
  ggtitle("Iris data")
```
Interpretation:  This plot uses the theme_hc() for a clean backgrouns and clear grid lines

# Legend location
```{r}
ggplot(mpg,
 aes(x = displ, y=hwy, color = class)) +
 geom_point(size = 4) +
 labs(title = "Diplacement by Highway Mileage") +
 theme_minimal() +
 theme(legend.position = "top") 
```
Interpretation: This theme_minimal() theme offers a clean design, with minimal background elements and a focus on the data. The legend.position = "top" adjustment places the legend above the plot, ensuring clear and accessible categorization of the data points.

```{r}
ggplot(mpg,
 aes(x = displ, y=hwy, color = class)) +
 geom_point(size = 4) +
 labs(title = "Diplacement by Highway Mileage",
 color = "Automobile\nClass") +
 theme_minimal() +
 theme(legend.title.align=0.5)
```
Interpretation: The theme_minimal() theme provides a simple, clean design that emphasizes the data, while the 'legend.title.align=0.5' centers the legend title.


# Labels 

```{r}
ggplot(mpg,
 aes(x = displ, y=hwy,
 color = class,
 shape = factor(year))) +
 geom_point(size = 3,
 alpha = .5) +
 labs(title = "Mileage by engine displacement",
 subtitle = "Data from 1999 and 2008",
 caption = "Source: EPA (http://fueleconomy.gov)",
 x = "Engine displacement (litres)",
 y = "Highway miles per gallon",
 color = "Car Class",
 shape = "Year") +
 theme_minimal()
```
Interpretation: This theme_minimal() theme provides a clean and straightforward design, focusing on the data with minimal distractions. The use of this theme ensures that the plotâ€™s elements, such as color and shape, are highlighted effectively, enhancing clarity and readability.
